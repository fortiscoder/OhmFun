# OhmFun
Ohms law resistor calculator and more. Includes four items:
1. **OhmCalculator** - .NET Core console application for calculating a resistors value based on the 4 color bands.
2. **OhmCalculatorTests** - xUnit Test project for the .NET Core console application
3. **SubItemFun** - .NET Core application to report an item's summary
4. **Bracket.ts** - Typescript script to make sure that brackets in a string have matching closing brackets

The first three are within the **OhmFun.sln** solution file.

Thanks!
